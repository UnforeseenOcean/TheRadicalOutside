The lights just went out. The lights don't last forever in a place like this.                                                                                                   
But no matter, I have the world's engineering knowledge in my head, and I can 
fix the lights.

The fuse is blown. I replace it. There had been attempts before me to find this
ece left here in the 20s. Most of the time, they just looked at the 
walls for pictures, or ringing the objects that looked like they would make
sound, in hopes for a melody. I was told perhaps, that it might be a primitive
code, whose only task was to push colors to a flat screen.

The fix the rusted cables. The whole reason I'm talking through my process is
because I'm supposed to leave some kind of audit trail. Audit trail, would you 
believe the nerve they have! Would they think I'm slacking off?

The lights turn on. My excitement is contrasted with the decaying shelves of
books surrounding me. I had found an undiscovered room on this site, which
others have missed. That should be no surprise, I was written to do this job.
I grab a book, and it's much thinner than it appears, oweing to the thick dust caking it. 

After hours of reading, I begin putting some of the pieces together. The books
describe the history of an ancient race. A theme keeps coming back again and 
again in these stories, that these people seem to repeat their mistakes over and
over again. Forgetting. It's like destroying memory, except unwilfully.
Humans cannot help it, their hardware is made like that. But "unwillfully
destroying" is a concept that I can only comprehend in theory. The words soon
trail off into gibberish. I recognize the tell tale words and symbols in an
ancient assembly language. Reciting this code could be quite harmful. I really
should ask for permission, but the reception is really bad in here. My curiosity
gets the better of me. 

I read the first few words...and the lights go out. They don't last forever in a
place like this. But no matter, I have the world's knowledge in my head, and I
can fix the lights.
