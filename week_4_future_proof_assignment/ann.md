 --an early example of ___’s work that is often cited as a turning point for the post-parasitism movement of the late 21st century.


*Step 1: Obtain one medium sized pig; a 250-pound Berkshire pig is recommended.*
The pig snuffles under the florescent lights, conspicuously organic against the polished grey cement of the museum floor.  

*Step 2: Seal the pig within an airtight chamber.*
The pig is separated from the crowd of Connoisseurs by a glass dome which had, minutes earlier, descended from the ceiling on four thick steel cables.  It hit the floor with a shuddering boom, a sound the nonchalant pig acknowledged with nothing more than a quiver of its back left haunch.  

A lone technician drops down after the dome like a spider, trailing behind her an articulated silver tube which she attaches to an inconspicuous nub on the apex of the dome before retreating back into the shadowy rafters far above the murmuring crowd.

*Step 3: Carefully inject the modified Beauveria bassiana containing Symphony in Three Colors into the chamber.*
The overheads lower until the pig stands alone in a puddle of white light.  

“Welcome.” The curator, who drifted to the center of room sometime during the preceding activities, smiles at the assembled art connoisseurs.  “On behalf of the Museum of Modern Art I'd like to thank you all for coming out tonight.  Please keep your masks secured, we don't want a repeat of what happened in Bilbao.” She pauses, waiting for the scattered laughter to subside. “Then, without further ado.” She lifts a purple latex-gloved hand high and waggles the syringe containing the artwork. Turning towards the pig, she presses the syringe into a rubber capped orifice on the side of the dome and injects its contents.

A ventilator judders to life.

Inside the dome, the pig noses a handful of wrinkled turnips left out by sympathetic assistant. 

*Step 4: Observe for 20-30 minutes.  If no activity is observed, return to step 1 and repeat.*
After a few silent minutes the piece begins to take shape.  The pig looks up at the crowd and the visitor closest to its head notices a smudge of blood on its snout.

The visitor slightly to her left sees the first sore.  On the pig’s left hind haunch a small pustule has formed.  It’s quickly followed by a second, and then a third.  Soon, a golden effervescence spreads, like a bottle of champagne uncorked and spilling across the pig’s back and legs.  The pig twists around, curious to observe the cause of the sudden tickling sensation.  The visitors gasp and press their masks against their faces.  A few of the less artistically inclined move towards the exits. 

The pustules balloon to twice, then three times their original size.  Their borders spread and ooze, stretching out to meet one another, joining together, growing larger.  The pustules burst one after another and a bouquet of chitinous blooms erupts from the pig’s back.

The pig sinks to a kneel, heavy under the weight of the Symphony.  The guests murmur appreciatively as the pig is obscured by the billowy white, pink, and yellow fungi that press together, filling the sealed glass enclosure.
