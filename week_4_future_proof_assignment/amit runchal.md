Caravaggio Deep Learning Restoration Discussion
Notes: Deep learning analysis of available pigments in the 16th and 17th centuries along with advances in regressive computer vision have revealed that it is possible that the work of traditional art restorers for decades has been subtly reinforcing notions of chiaroscuro influenced by art historians. It’s possible that the original artistic intent revealed far more vibrancy than we associate with the artist, raising questions of artistic intent.

ESCALATION: All-Hands Discussion of Cease and Desist Lawsuit by South Asian Economic Region
Notes: We host the works of several works curated during the seminal API.AI movement that have been recently deemed immoral and illegal to perform in the South Asian Economic Region. Since Nueva Contemporary’s role as curator and facilitator for the art is hosting the servers and maintaining the VPN for the performing computers to exhibit and interpret the artwork, we face both economic sanctions for our code running in those regions. We have hired outside legal firm Munger, Tolles and Olson to represent us in this matter which may reach UN High Court. This meeting is mandatory and will likely run long.
