Fernando streams in and sits down, letting out a whiff of air. He spends a few moments picking the right environment for our interview, before settling on a lush pink garden of blocks. -- I like the weird ones - he says, his mixed accent coming through in crunched bits. Days before the PreNet Data Center opens his retrospective, he lets me prod his mind about it.

**Are there archives of your old work?**

i don’t think i remember most of what i was working on 40 years ago, just like then i didn’t remember what i was working on 10 years before

i did some sort of mentorship or school or something in new york, i don’t remember, it got me thinking about archiving. about the future. i wasn’t thinking about the future at all, i was always living a few months at a time, so I started keeping some records, but it all got wiped out in the shutdown anyways.

i remember thinking a lot about memory. my dad started to lose his when i was in my early 30s. I didn’t get to see him much because i was always traveling and moving to different places. Back in the day once kids figured out they didn’t need to be sitting in an office all day, that was it, noone wanted to stay in one place, I sure didn’t. So there’s no paper trail, there’s no apartment with drawers full of old hard drives, no attic full of boxes with old laptop computers and 3D displays.
so the museum had to go digging.
i hate that they had to use those horrible archive companies. you have to spend all this money just to get something from the old net. they have your old self, they’ve got who you were back then, in a fridge somewhere. and you always have to pay, for every little piece of it. it’s like they’re holding your young self hostage and you can’t get them out. only in america that’d be legal. nothing changes.

But yeah, my dad. Memory is weird. I was so self conscious about my own memory back then. i went back and forth between wanting to preserve as much as possible, write it all down, take all the pictures, and wanting to live in the moment, just experience it. But what good are those experiences if you don’t remember them?

On the other hand, what good is storing it all if most of it is meaningless anyways? like keeping train tickets and movie stubs, in the end they’re just trash.

**What hardest period to find work from?**

my earliest days are lost, at least the digital part. probably for the better.

some of what was in the old internet you can probably buy from the archives, but how do you even parse any of it? probably just teenage angst well into my thirties. part of me wishes i’d kept more physical copies of the work I was doing. but it would’ve been unreadable anyways.

probably the hardest part to find was everything I did when I went dark, i think that was after the reelection or maybe even before that, when they really started cracking down on foreigners and what they were saying on the old net. you’d have trouble coming back from overseas, you’d get all these questions, you’d have weird things happen on your computer, all sorts of things, they were really watching. so i moved all my files and everything out of the country, started only talking to people through encrypted chats, keeping my files encypted, stuff like that. so all of that is lost.

I ended up finding some 2D video from when we all carried around camera phones. 
and most work i do still have is from after the shutdown.

**I’m imagining your work changed after the internet went away.**

i know it wasn’t for the best of reasons but i’m kind of glad they pulled the plug, it was a matter of time, i just thought it’d slowly change into something else, I didn’t think it’d be as dramatic or sudden. but life goes on and people find new ways of being shitty to each other. I was glad I didn’t have to see it all day every day. 

i remember in those first few months of just shock there was really no point on making anything on your computer if you couldn’t send it to anyone. so we started organizing events in the neighborhood, around the city, seeing people in person. i missed my friends from abroad but i think we were all happier in the end.

that’s when i started with the smell work, i wanted to work on something physical before they ran the net again.

**Are you excited to revisit some of your old work at the museum?**

i’m glad they got my old games work to run again, that took a lot of legal back and forth to let them even run an emulator. 

i just hope people are open minded and can stand sitting down for more than a minute to play with a 2D piece that doesn’t give them any credits. i hope they give it a chance.
