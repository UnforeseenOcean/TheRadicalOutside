Prompt:
“Imagine how a museum conservator would approach preserving your work for a show in 40 years. What issues would arise? There’s no such thing as too much science fiction, I think.”


Context:
Voyager Golden Record (wikipedia)
The Voyager Golden Records are phonograph records that were included aboard both Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977. Although their original mission was to study only the planetary systems of Jupiter and Saturn, both Voyagers are now tasked with exploring interstellar space. The records contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial lifeform, or for future humans, who may find them. Those records are considered as a sort of a time capsule. The Voyager Golden Record contains images, a variety of natural sounds, musical selections from different cultures and eras, spoken greetings in multiple languages, and printed messages.

Castor and Pollux (wikipedia)
From Greek/Roman mythology. Twins - Castor was mortal and Pollux was immortal. When Castor was killed, Pollux asked Zeus to let him share his own immortality with his twin to keep them together, and they were transformed into the constellation Gemini.


Make Me Obsolete
This project is loosely inspired by the Black Mirror episode, “Be Right Back.” 

An ongoing series of pieces I’ve been thinking about for the past year, about separating myself  into the parts that I consider to be explicitly human. So far, we consider expressive things, like feelings/emotion, or dreaming, or dancing, to be human. For example, sketching on location is a way to embed memory, how I remember times and places. I consider it to be very personal and human (as opposed to just taking an immediate picture), and my artistic style has evolved over the years and responds differently to different environments. What if I could teach a machine to actually draw like me (not just applying a filter or style transfer to images)? It could then travel to places or times I’ve never been, and record them in my “hand”. 


While other artists have done each of these things separately (chatbots, plotter drawing, etc), how do they come together to make what I consider to be unique about myself?

“So explain this again, please.” Ryder grabbed a pen out of her front pocket and stared intently across the table. “I understand we’re sending the Pollux spacecraft as a sort of spiritual successor to Voyager, a Golden Record part deux. Launch in two years and we’re still working out the details...but it’s going to be full of art? I’m still a little unclear.”


Julian, Director of Preservation, carefully poured hot water over her tea bag and took the seat across from Ryder. “As we know with the original Voyager Golden Record… Poetry, prose - it’s impossible to translate accurately. Forget about trying to send a dance to aliens. So all we can send are visuals, in the form of photography; and sound and music, which we have on more recordings, and now a couple new media art pieces…” 


Julian slid the brief across over the table. “Well this one is very human, at least.”


Ryder raised an eyebrow. “Make Me Obsolete? By who…?” She flipped through the brief. “Oh, Soetarman? Really? Why don’t we just put her later AI art in there? Way more recognizable. I I mean, this Obsolete from 2018, it’s still very early career, she’s still in her 20s, her good stuff isn’t until like a decade later...”


“Mmm the selection committee was very clear that they only wanted art forms that were unmistakably human. None of the “artificial intelligence what is consciousness making art” stuff; it gets too blurry. While this piece is a little borderline on other merits, of course it’s not a true AI. Anyways, I hear the AI Preservation Project over in Little San Fran has already claimed that body of work and won’t let anybody else license it. Julian looked back to Ryder. “Honestly, I think there were better artists we could have included, but the committee chose this piece. It’s not bad. And well...you know we don’t have many original art pieces left after we lost New York.” 


“Ha, what else did those nerds on the committee select as ‘art’? That toilet sculpture? That canvas covered in red paint?” 


Julian sighed. “It’s about context. We put all our Impressionist art in here, all the Monet and whatnot; aliens have no idea what a water lily pond actually looks like in reality. They don’t know the order of all the art movements, the zeitgeist that led into abstract impressionism. Imagine, if we put in Surrealism pieces or the neo-Meme era? They would think our entire civilization was made of melting clocks and flying rainbow cats. Unless....” Julian tapped her fingers on the table thoughtfully and looked away. “How do you think aliens would react to conceptual art? Suppose we gave them instructions, a la Lawrence Weiner? What would an extra-terrestrial version of 4’33” sound like?”


Ryder rolled her eyes. “Dammit Julian, I’m an engineer, not a philosopher or art historian. I don’t think I’ve ever even seen a water lily pond in real life myself.” She tapped her pen. “Alright, I have to rebuild a working version for both the Castor installation here on Earth and a twin version for the Pollux spacecraft. I just need to understand it enough so I can make it work.”


A faint tremor shook dust from the ceiling into Julian's mug. She drank from it anyway, pulling a face.


“This is from a series Soetarman did in 2018, Make Me Obsolete. ‘An artistic attempt to identify and compartmentalize the creative aspects of her person that were uniquely human, and then recreate them with machines.’ There’s a whole series - teaching a bot how to chat like her, generating random associations in her style...hmm the dancing one was a failure.”


“Anyways, this” - Julian reached over and flipped to a new page - “this little program will see things and draw them the way she did. It’s not quite a filter or a style transfer system, more like a piece of art that makes more art in the way she would make it. It’s in here; read the specs,” Julian pointed. “It’s a bit confusing when you just try to just read about it, you can see from these diagrams and this video…”


“What’s great about this piece is how it works in different contexts. I mean, this piece can go on to draw the universe! Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune... Almost as if Soetarman were actually there to witness and draw alien landscapes. If extraterrestrials discover it and have any type of optical sensory input, they’ll be able to see it…” 


“So I’m rebuilding a machine that draws like this woman from forty years ago...and sending it off on a spacecraft.” Ryder crossed her arms. The ceiling lights flickered off, then back on again. 


“Well, yes. Think of it this way. The early explorers hand-drew maps of the territories they explored as a record for future expeditions. We laugh at how inaccurate they were, but some of those beautiful old maps carried the impressions of their creators. When we developed photography and imaging, we gained more accuracy but lost the humanity of hand-drawn maps. In a way, with drawing, we’re going back to our roots.”


Julian continued, “The original Voyager was an interstellar exploration probe. All the photographs and data collection were transmitted back home for science and further study. The Golden Record, our artistic time capsule of humanity, was just piggybacking on a scientific expedition. This is almost the opposite.”


Ryder sighed. “That’s the whole point of the Pollux space probe? A spacecraft full of...art?”


“Well, there’s no point in exploring anymore. The radiation or the bullets will kill us all in a decade or two, so there’s nobody back home to transmit it to. No more future expeditions. So with Pollux, our last spacecraft, we can be a bit more expressive, a little less accurate, a little more...poetic, if I may say. Instead of saying hello to whoever’s out there, we’re saying goodbye.” Julian paused and sipped her tea. 


Julian looked away again. “We’ll all be dead and everything we built will crumble back into dust. And we can’t send them our mountains or buildings or speeches or high-speed trains. But we can at least send them our art. At least that will get to live on somehow…” The room shook again. “That’s why we also have Castor. Two copies, two twin records. Castor stays here on Earth with us mortals in case anyone finds this planet, while we send Pollux to live forever in the stars.”


Julian placed her empty cup back on the table. “It’ll be proof we were here for whatever future finds us.” 


“What a monologue, Julian. Maybe we should put a copy of you in this record.” Ryder deadpanned. She sighed and leaned back in her chair. “My head hurts. I could use a break.”


The siren blared twice, then silence. Julian checked her messages.


“Oh, Book says that the raids are moving south. It may be safe enough to go outside soon without getting shot. We could maybe even catch the sunset before evening lockdown.”  


[Ryder thought of the radioactive dead world up on the surface. It had been weeks since she had been outside. She hated going out into the wasteland, but a sunset was still a sunset.]


Ryder looked around the room, sighed. “I could use some sun. We still have time.”
