##Characters : 

*C(curator : Colin - pure human) : Colin is 40 years old senior curator who has been working in this museum for 10 years. Specializing in 20th and early 21st century art.

H(technologist : Hyojin - AI) - Hyojin is 20’s looking technologist who came from lab experiment embedding AI into robotic body. It has vast amount of knowledge but confused about identity.*


Colin looks down at Hyojin, who is standing oddly straight with picture smile.


C: Alright, are you ready to get started?

H: Yes, if you mean by this project we are given.

C: First jobs are always tricky, and this one especially.

H: I’m ready.

C: So how are you feeling?

H: I am well. If you are asking me about strong feeling deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships with others. You know, that I don’t really feel.

Colin looking sorry and embarrassed but Hyojin seems calm.

C: Oh that’s right. Sorry, I always forget. You guys all look so.. Normal. How am I supposed to always remember in the back of my head, that you’ve got that chip in the back of yours?

H: It’s all good. No need to apologize. Just consider me and my database at your service. 

C: That’s kind of you. Remind me again which knowledge volumes you’re specific to?

H: I was loaded with the essentials for curatorial technology and comprehensive art history, but my specifics are to ancient and folk art dates from 2120 BC to 1900 AD. I received one last download for Agricultural Science before reporting to this project. I wasn’t given an explanation why, however.

C: Ah, perfect. I’ll tell you why. We’re working on a collection of prints from the 2010s that had been filed under “agricultural activism”. Look at my screen here. They’re illustrations, some by hand, some digital. There was a call put out and 100 artists each made a piece to draw attention to the shrinking seed diversity. It’s shame that such a beautiful project never made an impact. Just another couple of decades before the ag co’s made it official and finished it all off. Say, have you ever tried corn?

H: No. The Download Center I was at received rice rations, not corn. But I know from John Burroughs essay that it tastes like milk and sugar.

C: Yeah I heard that, too. God I wish I could try any of the old.grains just once. You know last weekend I saw a real cucumber. But of course it was in a glass box. Just a display to draw you in to sample the new artificial pickle juice that everyone’s drinking these days. Anyways, can you take a look at the briefing notes and see if the scanners found anything new?

H: Actually, yes. Here it says it’s detecting biomatter embedded in each print.

C: That’s just the organics in the inks. 

H: No, no. The scan shows they’re all concentrated into specks, not spread throughout the print. And the initial DNA spectrum reading shows each print with a unique ID that my database don’t recognize.

C: Let me take a look. Whoa, you know what these are? They’re seeds!

H: Seeds?

C: Seeds! Yeah, like seeds that you plant in the ground. If the indicators on this scan are correct, it also shows that these seeds are fertile. You know when’s the last time non-sterile plant matter existed outside the ag co labs?

H: It was 38 years ago. Before the “Round Up” as it’s known.

C: Yes. Yes, of course you know. So you also know that we need to save these! We need to plant these! Hey, does your agriculture download include the technical stuff? Preserving, planting, harvesting… all that stuff. Man I don’t know anything about how to grow things. I don’t think anyone under 65 does.

H: I do. There are specifics based on the plant and the growing conditions, but the basics are straightforward. Though I must analyze current soil to check mineral nutrients level that requires. However, I believe you’re losing sight of the goals of the project. Our task is to archive and curate. We are not farmers.

C: I know we’re not farmers. But we have to do something. As archivists, we have a duty to save these pieces. Obviously these works are more than just prints. The seeds are part of the piece. They’re works of art. And as curators, we have a duty to fulfill and continue the spirit of the artists. Don’t you think they’d want us to save and plant these seeds?

H: I suppose that is true. The artist’s statement does say “These prints are made in reference to our agricultural past, our dire present, and uncertain future. If that uncertainty turns to bleakness, we hope these 100 pieces can provide hope and an alternative path.” 

C: Sure sounds like they want us to do some gardening.

H: I am sorry to interrupt your excitement, I have to remind you that our assignment is to archive and curate. We must catalog this finding so it can be documented and presented.

C: But that’s the worst thing that we could do. Think about it.

H: What do you mean? I am using thought for rational judgment.

C: Think about the big picture. Step outside of our museum. The second we tell anyone what we found, the Department of Organic Control will be knocking at our door and confiscating everything we’ve got. They’ll burn the seeds and that’ll be that. 

H: I understand your points. Unfortunately, my databases are unable to reconcile this dilemma. 

C: Can you reconcile this dilemma? Use your emotions. Don’t engage your databases.

H: I understand what you mean, but my training didn’t include E-Intelligence. It’ll be a number of project cycles before it develops to a working level.

C: So, now what? I’m taking these seeds. You’re not going to stop me, are you? You know, I could really use your help. We can do this. We can make a difference. What do you say?

H: Well, we can curate, and we can archive.

C: What do you mean?

H: A curated garden is born from an archive of seeds.
