In "On Art Activism" Boris Groys presents his argument in defense of art activism. There were a few claims that I found really interesting to think about. The one that sticks out in my mind is that by claiming to be socially driven - artists should be aware of the extremely fine line they must consider in avoiding visual qualities exclusively and neutralizing the practical effect of their action through aestheticization. I find it really interesting to think of art activists as active practioners of suppression and restriction. There were also a few points I found a little extreme - for example when he states that "in our society, art is traditionally seen as useless" or "to be creative means, of course, to bring into the world not only something new, but also something betterâ€”better functioning, better looking, more attractive".
