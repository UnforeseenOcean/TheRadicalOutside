# -isms and -ums

I haven't digested all of text yet but few things stuck with me. It was interesting view on what is art. Rephrase birth of art. First few paragraphs was questions I had myself, the fine line or call it tension between art and activism. Also what this distinction between art and design. Part about the french revolution was kind of cracking moment for me. I've always questioned about what is art(still not sure yet) and questioned about all those objects and heritage of past in museum art? Also all the art history and art philosophy is based on western philosophy so it is very alien to me. In the end article didn't really speak to me about art activism but surely made me think more about what is art.



>The French Revolution turned the design of the Old Regime into what we today call art, i.e., objects not of use but of pure contemplation. This violent, revolutionary act of aestheticizing the Old Regime created art as we know it today. Before the French Revolution, there was no art—only design. After the French Revolution, art emerged—as the death of design.
>The goal of design is to aesthetically improve the status quo—to make it more attractive. Art also accepts the status quo—but it accepts it as a corpse, after its transformation into a mere representation. In this sense, art sees contemporaneity not merely from the revolutionary, but rather, the postrevolutionary perspective. One can say: modern and contemporary art sees modernity and contemporaneity as the French revolutionaries saw the design of the Old Regime—as already obsolete, reducible to pure form, already a corpse.
>Thus, total aestheticization not only does not preclude political action; it creates an ultimate horizon for successful political action, if this action has a revolutionary perspective.
