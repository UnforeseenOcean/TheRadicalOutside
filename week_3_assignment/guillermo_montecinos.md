# Do artifacts have politics? - Langdon Winner

The author asks if the political problem of technology is due to the technology itself or due to the social and economical forces in which they are embedded. Technology can’t be good or evil, says the author, because what matters are the reason it was developed for. Anyway, technology can impact the society, because it changes people's behaviour by building new orders in our world. Facing impacts generated by modern development, the author proposes there are two ways to deal with it: the first is related with supporting or being against new technology, whilst the second is related to choosing the way that technology is modified. The author concludes artifacts doesn’t have politics itselves, but we have to take care of the social context they were developed and the reasons underlying on it.
