When it comes to the “aestheticization” of politics, I am probably still part of the old camp of believing that it acts as a distracting force. The whole impulse of the article and of political artists is based on an idea that art is not useful to begin with. I think if there is ever something that repelled me from making art from a political perspective it was that.  It does not mean that I think art is without a function either or that it should be. Instead, I think for many artists that create that there is a spiritual element in creation, and by spiritual I mean working within the inner world. In this dimension, art is incredibly functional, but in an irrational way that doesn’t meet the criteria of Western thinking. It’s not that I think art should be used in a political context, but that the article even fails to consider this application is telling.
