This paper correctly identifies one of my major concerns with art activism - that of it's effectiveness to affect change. Groys leads us through the history of aestheticization, arguing how it was used during the French Revolution as a more effective iconoclasm, and extends it to modernity, saying that it is a tool used by the avant garde to reject a future by envisioning its end.

Even if one would to take Groys' word for its worth, it's hard to see why, according to these explanations, is art activism a viable alternative. The contradiction of helplessness is not explained("only self-contradictory practices are true in a deeper sense of the word"). It's also ends on the note that art "needs to not distinguish between victory and failure", which seems like a veiled political statement of its own. Finally, it says art "creates an ultimate horizon for successful political action, if this action has a revolutionary perspective". It seems to me that this is not a very strong statement in support of art activism, as it supposes that art activism is a backdrop against which a seemingly more important act must happen.
