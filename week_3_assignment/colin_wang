I feel that this essay starts strong explaining the differences between art activism and criticism, and art and design in regards to aestheticization. However, from here I believe the author diverges from speaking about activism, and instead focuses on the history and merits of aestheticization without fully bringing it back to activism. But perhaps I’ve missed the point.

One point I found interesting was that art takes away from the activism. Whether this can be qualitatively determined, I don’t know, but I definitely see the point. It’s easy for the general public to view art activism as gimmicky. And often when the artist has genuine intentions of activism, those intentions are lost when viewers don’t have the opportunity to or care about learning about those intentions. So what can be done? Maybe it’s upon the artist to craft their pieces in a way that those intentions are inherent and indubitable. But according to Groys, wouldn’t this then becomes design, and no longer art (as in political design)?
