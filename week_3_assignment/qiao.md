### Field Observations

Art activism as a combination of two discipline is inheritally  on the fence of attacks for multiple fields.  Whether it’s construct of aestheticazation as weapon of the weaponization of aesthetics, brings to light the practical & functional as objects of contemplation.  Boris draws a nice parallel to the museum as cemetery for art, or rather a storage room of cultural values to be put away — obsolete.  Thinking of museum goers as grave visitor intended to gain culture without remorse, as observers of human debris of constant reminder of chapters of ideology set in stone.  **All that is solid melts into air**  >> all that is air gels into past, sticks on those white walls in mausoleums. 

### Fragments that resonated: 

Artistic aestheticization => defunctionalization of the practical and working of a system.  ie. French revolution, defunctionalized / aestheticized  `turned the design of the Old Regime into what we today call art, i.e., objects not of use but of pure contemplation`

Ostracizing what was once utilitarian to aesthetic contemplation

```
However, they were interested in the technological modernity 
only with the goals of aestheticizing modernity, 
defunctionalizing it, to reveal the ideology of 
progress as phantasmal and absurd.
```

```
Modern and contemporary art wants to make dysfunctional things out 
of functional things, to betray expectations, to reveal the 
invisible presence of death where we tend to see only life.”  
``` 
Life is thus more present with Death.
