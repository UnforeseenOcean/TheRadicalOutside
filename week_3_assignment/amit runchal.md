This is a remarkably confused and occasionally incoherent piece that, despite it's frequent poor reasoning, manages to bring up some relatively fascinating points. I wish I had more time to discuss the many things I found flawed about it as it would help me understand the points it is attempting to make better as well as formulate my own, but let's talk for a minute about this one key phrase here that seems to be at the central point of what he's trying to achieve:

"Only if we learn to aestheticize the lack of gifts as well as the presence of gifts, and thus not differentiate between victory and failure, do we escape the theoretical blockage that endangers contemporary art activism."

if only the piece had tried to examine the concepts in here instead! If only it had even shown examples of art activism that had emerged from the sort of thinking he promulgates.

The difference here is that this is largely a long-winded way of saying that this feels like a justification and a rallying cry to generate hope. But:

"Total aestheticization means that we see the current status quo as already dead, already abolished. And it means further that every action that is directed towards the stabilization of the status quo will ultimately show itself as ineffectiveâ€”and every action that is directed towards the destruction of the status quo will ultimately succeed."

The acceptance of a notion of a status quo at all is where this argument fails for me. It actually creates the same sort of utopian dimensions, both horizontal and vertical, that he is trying so hard to overcome in order to show the value of art activism.

This would have been far better if he thought more about his anxieties IMO and more time laying out examples to prove his point, which maybe would have also shown that his point needed a little more time to cook
