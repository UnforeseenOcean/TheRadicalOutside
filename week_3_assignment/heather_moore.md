I had trouble with this essay. It includes many contradicting narratives written with double negatives and interchangeable terms.

Let's follow one such thread:

1. The author says, "we are living in a time of total aestheticization" and 
2. that "total aestheticization [...] creates an ultimate horizon for successful political action". 

To summarize that in a few words: we're living in a time that supports political action.

The the author turns around and warns, "Only if we learn to aestheticize [...] do we escape the theoretical blockage that endangers contemporary art activism".

As a reader, I am left wondering if activism is endangered. We just learned that we were living in a time that supports political action. We live in a time of total aestheticization. Why is there suddenly a call to learn to aestheticize? Can you have total aestheticization without people having learned to do it? Perhaps activism and political action are not the same for the author and the quotes are unrelated, but that's hard to parse.

Looking beyond the difficulty of the language and idea presentation, there is one theme that is presented again and again: exposing the difference between art and design. Art destroys. Design improves. Art doesn't have to have a purpose. Design is filled with purpose. Art loves inequality. Design is trying to close the inequality gap.

But wait! Again we have confusion!

Author says "[art is] not popular precisely because [it] goes against the normal way things are supposed to go". Then the author tells us that design is fighting against the status quo, "[designers] tend to think that this inequality should be corrected by upward mobility". That's right! Designers and artists are working against their respective grains. Amidst an argument about difference, we have a call from the author (perhaps unintentionally) to view them as similiar. WAT.

I am sad that I don't connect with this article-- It's so passionate. I think there's an overwhelming desire to have the reader connect with the specialness of art and the need to preserve a particular form of it. I'm lost in the arguments, however. I did not come into an understanding of why it's important that art is different, or why I should care about it at all.
