Week 2: Radical Outside, art activism



This article is so difficult to understand I wonder who this is being argued to/for? 

Amit’s presentation comes to mind and his discussion of the difference between theoria (thinking), poiesis (making), and praxis (doing).  I agree with Arendt that praxis is the most important level of the active life.  This piece seems so far into the domain of theory and so disconnected from action that it’s meaningless.

The author’s conclusion, as I understand it, is basically that all artists are activists since art, by definition, assume the status quo is dead and likewise activists are trying to abolish the status quo.

I have two problems with this: 

1. I’m not convinced that aestheticizing the status quo (as art does) is a revolutionary act
2. I’m not convinced that activists are trying to abolish the status quo

His response to critics from the traditionally activist side is that art does not celebrate the status quo, but comments on it from a point in the future where the status quo has already been abolished, thus assuming that it will be abolished. He argues that aestheticization is a revolutionary act because it defunctionalizes the subject being aestheticized and, by displaying it, ensures the subject cannot be revived.  It doesn’t kill the subject, but rather assumes it is already dead and locks it into this death-state.

Basically what Groys is saying is that activist artists are not required to actually act, their art does not need to do anything or incite people to do anything (vs. design).  He essentially lets artists off the hook by saying, “the very existence of your work supports the demise of the status quo so all you need to do to be helpful to the cause is to keep making work.”  I disagree.  I think activism requires action.  Activists are actively trying to bring about change; they are not just waiting for the current system to play itself out.  If your work does not cause anyone to think differently or act differently, then it is not an effective piece of activism.

He also seems to conflate activists and revolutionaries.  I don’t think that activists always want an end to the status quo.  Oftentimes, activists are trying to improve conditions for their subjects within the current system.  An end to the status quo would destroy the activist as well as supporters of the current system.  While seemingly contradictory, this makes perfect sense.  To use an example from Adrian Piper’s essay [Ideology, Confrontation and Political Self-Awareness](http://umintermediai501.blogspot.com/2008/01/ideology-confrontation-and-political.html), an activist who draws her sense of self from her anti-war efforts, if confronted with evidence that problematizes her work, may choose to ignore the evidence rather than admit her identity and self-worth was built on a false premise. 

At the heart of my disagreement with this article is that none of this seems to make any difference to the end result.  In general I take issue with art that is so theoretical and inscrutable that viewers are not able to divine the author’s message.  Or, perhaps worse, viewers conclude a contradictory or harmful message.  If understanding the revolutionary nature of the art requires slogging through pages of incomprehensible art theory, is the piece still effective as a piece of activism?  If all activist art is is a record from the future telling us to take heart, change will happen eventually, how is that helpful?  It seems more a call to passivity than anything else.


Notes:
- What happened at the Berlin Biennale:
  - http://blog.berlinbiennale.de/en/allgemein-en/7th-berlin-biennale-for-contemporary-politics-by-artur-zmijewski-27718
  - https://www.fairobserver.com/region/europe/no-velvet-glove-criticism-towards-political-effectiveness-art/
- the aestheticization of politics rooted in modern art and the politicization of aesthetics rooted in political design.
  - WHAT is this person saying?
  - design wants to change and improve reality whereas art accepts reality as is, and also the failure of that reality. ?
  - putting objects into museums de-politicizes them.  like mausoleums and stuff.  so art is inherently de-political?
- contemporary art activism is caught between these two worlds.  it wants to use art as a tool to improve the status quo (art as political design) but it also wants art to be art which means that art accepts the status quo, does not think it can improve, and assumes the whole system is going to blow up.
- metanoia: change in one's way of life resulting from penitence or spiritual conversion.

Quotes I like:
- "Art activists do not want to merely criticize the art system or the general political and social conditions under which this system functions. Rather, they want to change these conditions by means of art—not so much inside the art system but outside it, in reality itself.”
- "Art activists do want to be useful, to change the world, to make the world a better place—but at the same time, they do not want to cease being artists.” → was it thought before that it was not possible to be both at once?
- "And this means that art cannot be used as a medium of a genuine political protest—because the use of art for political action necessarily aestheticizes this action, turns this action into a spectacle and, thus, neutralizes the practical effect of this action.”
- “In our society, art is traditionally seen as useless.  So it seems that this quasi-ontological uselessness infects art activism and dooms it to failure. ”
- "At the same time, art is seen as ultimately celebrating and aestheticizing the status quo—and thus undermining our will to change it. So the way out of this situation is seen mostly in the abandoning of art altogether—as if social and political activism never fails as long as it is not infected by art viruses.”
- "I would argue that aestheticization is a much more radical form of death that traditional iconoclasm."
- “The museum institutionalizes the truly radical, atheistic, revolutionary violence that demonstrates the past as incurably dead. It is a purely materialistic death without return—the aestheticized material corpse functions as a testimony to the impossibility of resurrection.” → how does this relate to the Confederate monuments debate?
- “Design wants to change reality, the status quo—it wants to improve reality, to make it more attractive, better to use. Art seems to accept reality as it is, to accept the status quo. But art accepts the status quo as dysfunctional, as already failed—that is, from the revolutionary, or even postrevolutionary, perspective.”
- “This is why modern and contemporary art is not popular. It is not popular precisely because art goes against the normal way things are supposed to go.“
- “Modern and contemporary art wants to make things not better but worse—and not relatively worse but radically worse: to make dysfunctional things out of functional things, to betray expectations, to reveal the invisible presence of death where we tend to see only life.”
- “At the beginning of the 1970s, Joseph Beuys was inspired by the idea of human capital. In his famous Achberger Lectures that were published under the title Art=Capital (Kunst=Kapital), he argues that every economic activity should be understood as creative practice—so that everybody becomes an artist.”
- “Only if we learn to aestheticize the lack of gifts as well as the presence of gifts, and thus not differentiate between victory and failure, do we escape the theoretical blockage that endangers contemporary art activism.”
