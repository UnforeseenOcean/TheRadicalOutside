The arguments for unintended political consequences of technology resonate to me as particularly relevant today, as silicon valley’s racial and class biases come to light and both criticism of these and calls for government regulation is sometimes discarded as “anti-progress”.

Things I'm thinking about:
* Are hierarchical structures in non-industrial, digital organizations required? Are power structures necessary when building software? What does a democratic, non-hierarchical organization creating software look like?
* What are the politics (inherent or consequential) of smartphones and app design? Are the biases in these devices changing how we interact with others? Autocomplete and predictive text in phones use dictionaries that are rigorously manipulated by corporations with a strong effort to mantain a family-friendly american-centric aesthetic/functionality and, in consequence, reduces language to what’s acceptable in (american) society, making communication amongst marginalized groups more difficult (eg. texting “gay’, “queer”, writing non-american names, etc. is inherently harder).
* What are examples of contemporary technologies with inherent and intended politics? 
  * China's [Social Credit System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System)
* On the other end of technologies that can be modified to alter their political/societal effect are technologies whose implementation can be modified *after the fact* or struck down altogether, for example, with solar power's potential democratization of power use (and use during emergencies) being struck down in Florida through lobbying:
  * [Florida Power and Light lobbyists made it illegal to use solar during outages](http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-frustrated-with-fpl-after-hurricane-irma-9666311)
