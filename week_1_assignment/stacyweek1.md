We tend to put technology on this pedestal, sort of assuming its superiority and blindly following the rules it sets out for us. That is, after all, the message it was made to convey; technology is sleek, new, and sexy - it is “the future.” In his conclusion, though, Winner makes a powerful point: he notices how "people are often willing to make drastic changes in the way they live to accord with technological innovation *at the same time they would resist similar kinds of changes justified on political grounds*.” I’ve never looked at it like that! I think its true - we really do just accept the whatever technology is thrown at us as it hides under the guise of objectivity, assuming “that’s just the way it has to work.” This reminds me a lot of black-boxing, when the underlying framework of a machine is hidden from public understanding. This helps prevent unnecessary confusion, but it keeps people from knowing not only the inner workings of the artifact but also its motivations, biases, or likely consequences. Ultimately, I appreciate that Winner left room for multiple interpretations - artifacts are neither wholly guilty nor wholly innocent. I think the balance is crucial; it is a dynamic relationship between social context and the technology in itself that determines its effect on our lives.
