God I hate GitHub and Markdown lol. Reminds me how stuff like this keeps people out of tech even though it has all the appearance of openness and egalitarianism.

Anyways: this piece was pretty good. I think outside of the usual unthinking bias of Marxist readings of works present in here, it kinda encapsulates a lot of the modern trends to realizing that technology is not truly rational or free of bias. I'm uninterested in talking about the flaws of Marxist readings at the moment, though I will note that this shit is continuing to age poorly IMO.

It's funny how a lot of this stuff seems relatively obvious now, or obvious in 2017 in a way that it didn't in 2010: "There is no idea more provocative than the notion that technical things have political qualities." Is that still the case? I mean probably not, but it's pretty interesting to see this being discussed in the 70s.

This piece sort of reacts really strongly to the notion that technology is described as "democratizing, liberating forces" but really seems to object to that description in the first place. It's a valid argument I think, but I'm fundamentally curious about the author's opinions on what moral calculus he wants to use to measure technology or how to control it.

That's the fundamental interesting question that I think needs to be addressed. If you're going to create a space for moral judgement using subtle moral language that is encoded to reflect your values — you better let us understand how you want to control things (see: Engels). Especially if you're a white dude in a position of relative power trying to influence society.

"We understand that people have politics, not things". Dude needs to define _things_ a little better — it's actually a pretty loaded word in the context of this piece. A rock is a thing, and fire is a thing, and a tree is a thing. He means, clearly, inanimate objects that are created by humans in order to achieve a goal of some sort.

It is the construction of the thing that is where politics enters; thinkingly or not. Two things — together — that is where humans start to exist. It is why people care a lot about the thumb. I've always considered human behavior under relatively understood psychological constraints a fundamental design constraint that needs to be considered, and I've applied that rather unthinkingly and it clearly reflects my own interpretation and biases of how human beings react. The choice of those two things together reflect a lot of subtle internal assumptions.

The problem now, especially with software, is that _scale_ and _network_ really start to fuck with the ability of a creator of a technology to understand how they can interact. That gets compounded as we create systems that produce outputs we do not understand — machine learning is perhaps a perfect example of this. It's super weird because it may be impossible to recognize the political parts of the technology because we can not fundamentally understand the output or how the machine is functioning. 

This scares the shit out of me, a little.

(Aside: Social science =/= science lol. What a bullshit term left over and then clung to by insecure social science departments)

Here's another thing that's not considered in the piece because it couldn't have been considered at the time. Internet-based technology creates new forms of capital that are not strictly monetary and impossible to express in capitalist or Marxist scales of value IMO. The "network" is a new form of capital (maybe not new new but new in it's sheer, warping scale), "data" is another form of capital. It's interesting to note the scale of this capital value is not controlled by the state, was made possible through the creation of supposedly democratic and open systems, but the value created by those networks was centralized and collected by a few players. 

Human behavior is a real hard thing to design systems and politics for, and not much has changed. 

Blockchain (just like many internet technologies and standard) have actually explicitly mentioned political considerations and it's interesting to think about the fact that they actually embrace the political even though like most internet bros they will probably continue to misunderstand the implications of the technologies they create.

My actual notes when he writes this: "The theoretical tension we see here mirrors many troubles in the practice of freedom and authority that have muddied the tracks of socialist revolution." My actual notes were: LMAO. 

Millions and millions and millions of people killed will sure the muddy the fuck out of the tracks of the socialist revolution. It's always the fundamental asshole tension underlying Marxist critiques of things — this shit always goes off the rails in a way that is real morally problematic to consider the implications of, which is doubly ironic considering the use of that critique in a piece that talks about that sort of unstated politic influences of things like technology.

Ok, I said I wouldn't talk about this anymore — I just find the death of millions of people offensive when it's minimized in pursuit of a broader academic argument (and with actual exposure to a very socialist state — it's why I hate utopians).

Another thing that's interesting: that standards can be a liberating force for democracy and prevent undemocratic consolidations of power — but can also make it impossible to create new technologies. Chandler's argument is that large-scale systems require centralized, hierarchal managerial control holds true even with standards bodies but what's interesting is that the standards bodies don't control the capital that is produced by the work that enables the creation of that capital.

The broadest question for me: is it possible to understand the effects of politics of the technologies we create? It seems the answer, based on history, is no. There are limits to our perception, and we are operating, I think, at a scale where it is become impossible to understand our effects, especially when everything is connected. The butterfly effect is really, really terrifying to consider when it returns a reality where Donald Trump is president, and that's a relatively tame outcome to what could, can or will come next.
