# The Radical Outside
## CRITICAL THINKING OF TECHNOLOGY: The Radical Outside | Fall 2017


**Instructor:** Morehshin Allahyari | http://morehshin.com  | morehshin@gmail.com
**Class Times:** Tuesdays at 10am 
**Class Location:** School for Poetic Computation  |  http://sfpc.io/ 
@sfpc_school  | https://twitter.com/sfpc_school | 155 Bank St, New York, NY 10014
**Office Hours:** Tuesdays, 2-5pm 


**Course description**

This is a theory course for critical thinking of technology through the lens of activism, politics, and the 'outside'; to think and create beyond technology for technology's sake; to ask difficult questions; to read, learn, and engage in technology as a field of contemporary art practices and theories, as well as art historical systems. What will separate this course from many others is a collective effort (by all of us) for 'reflective thinking'; to not find comfort in how - up to this very day - the story of technology is told to us; by which figures and which systems. I hope that together we can build a new library of critical thinking and reading; written and processed by women (+LGBT) and POC.  This is a collaborative course for interrupting and re-building. 


**Expectations and Structure**

* Each week, two or three students from the class will present that week's readings. We will focus on a combination of historical and contemporary text.
* Read all the material and come prepared to discuss it in depth. Please bring other resources, authors and artists that you find relevant. Please see here for [presentation guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HtTwy6yakti5TaYL_oq0sgZo-mZSv_RGKruh3tff1m0/edit?usp=sharing). 
* Blog weekly about the readings and your thoughts. Think critically and post something that questions, criticizes, endorses, and/or adds to the reading or find other related material or resources that can juxtapose or compare the reading to something else you find relevant. 
* Participation in class discussions for readings, material that we watch in class, giving feedback to your peers is essential. 
* As this is primarily a discussion-based class, let's have all phones off. 
Best policy for laptop use: guidelines 
* Classroom hygiene 
* Best policy for speaking up, listening in 



Schedule (Please keep an eye on the schedule in this document every week). This is under construction and will be changed throughout the course. Please feel free to give feedback.

“A singularity is a point in space-time of such unfathomable density that the very nature of reality is brought into question. Associated with elusive black holes and the alien particles that bubble up from quantum foam at their event horizon, the term ‘singularity’ has also been co-opted by cultural theorists and techno-utopianists to describe moments of profound social, ontological, or material transformation—the coming-into-being of new worlds that redefine their own origins. By reflecting on Afrofuturism and digital colonialism, they will also question narcissistic singularities of ‘I,’ ‘here,’ and ‘now’, counter the rhetoric of technological utopias, and confound principles of human universality.”
