Reaction to Race, Surveillance and Empire

The thing that interests me in reading this is both my total lack of surprise of the facts of the paper but that fundamentally I think it’s not going far enough in analyzing the problem. 

Outside of my usual issues with intellectuals using 19th century ideas is that they ignore both history and psychology in building more nuanced understandings of this. It’s a little bit terrifying because it ignores conceptually the more interesting role of the state in using technology to both surveil and monitor the other. All states do this regardless of political creed or ideology from fascist fundamentalist states to more liberal democracies. This is fundamentally a psychological error in analysis. 

The historical error — and what makes this more terrifying — is that technology is both accretive and impossible to control by ideology. To the latter: We may believe that nuclear bombs are fine if controlled by rational and democratic actors but even very poor countries have managed to obtain and start nuclear programs. This actually proves in some (I’m sure inconvenient way to 20th century leftists) that technology does have a trickle down effect. Surveillance techniques will spread even faster now and be used agains the Other because the very nature of modern software development demands or supports explicitly using incrementalism and documentation to improve the most important thing to people who ship software: their product.

Finally — my knowledge is limited but it increasingly appears that the real basis of moral philosophy applicable in this century is Arendt. There is very little more banal than a commit, and the scope of the implications between a short terminal command and what it means for millions of the Others that code is targeted towards.
