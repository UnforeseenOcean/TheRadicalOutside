In response to reading: Josh Scannell - What can an algorithm do                                                                                                                

The push for predictive policing using data is another example of our society's
desire to quantify our world around us. Numbers are clinical, they appear
objective, and they allow us to apply modeling tools to give us "insight". This
is a manifestation of software industry's tendency to want to simplify problems
so they can be 'solved', and to hide complexities, and culpability for handling
of this issues. For example, Scannell points out that crime is constantly being
redefined and contested by society, and that crime is "radically contingent on
circumstance".


However, everything in our world is being modelled, and I don't see that trend
going away. The corporations developing these products have little ability to
orient themselves to answer difficult, multi-faceted questions. I think it is
important for us to find a way to open algorithms up to public scrutiny so that
we can have dialogs around what the limitations of models are.  What would be
the effect, for example, if the same algorithms are run against different
datasets? How can algorithms better help police support their local communities?
