As "Race, surveillance, and empire" by Arun Kundnani and Deepa Kumar shows, racial motives or the concept of us versus them is an old approach by the people in power to maintain their power. This dates back from the settlers in 1670 to our current politics.

The people running political system are mainly concerned with keeping the system stable. Questioning it, or proactively changing it is usually not on their agenda. Since most western societies are governed by the principles of capitalism, a stable economy is the most important part of the system. From a political point of view, it is a logical action to try to control factors that can bring the system out of balance, e.g. political opponents, foreign governments, or civilians.

At the same time, technological progress is made within the free market and not by the government itself. This makes the government heavily reliant on the economy to keep advancing the technology. The interesting, and worrying part is, that this creates an almost *self-sufficient cycle*. The economy produces what the government needs, the result is a positive effect on the GDP. The inhumane premises on which surveillance are left to be to ignored.
