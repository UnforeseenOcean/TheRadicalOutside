* the ultimate irony(?) on the topic of surveillance is the fact that I won't publish part of my response in a public github repo for fear of the consequences of it being online *

Techonlogy will make it easier and more accessible for people in power to assert their dominance. and the values of technology will always be a reflection of those held by people in control of the systems in which it operates. I don't foresee a future where surveillance becomes less pervasive, but rather the opposite.

This reading was particularly depressing.
