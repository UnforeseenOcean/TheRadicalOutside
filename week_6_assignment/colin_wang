So is it a bad thing that we’re watched? If I was Muslim, would I feel differently? I remember when Snowden started dropping bombs, while the media went into a frenzy, I thought to myself, “is everybody really surprised?” Wasn’t that what the Patriot Act was all about? That was some 10 odd years before. I was younger then, and now I sympathize. Sure I might have “nothing to hide”, but as I’ve gotten older there’s nothing I value more than my own private space. Not because I have anything to hide, I just enjoy my freedom [America = Freedom (supposedly)]. Although I sympathize, I don’t think I quite empathize. I want to empathize, but I don’t. I think I’m just too far removed from the injustices that the surveilled face. I’d like to think that I’m an open and thoughtful person, and if even I have trouble empathizing, what are the chances regular American Joe gives a shit, or even has an inkling of recognition/understanding of the nuances of the issues?

As I often find, it seems to come down to education to break down ignorance, and the eternal search for balance. Security is important. Why bother with government if it cannot ensure the safety of its citizens. In this day and age, it unfortunately requires a little bit of big brother. But so is freedom. Are these two mutually exclusive? Is the tiger in the cage may be safe, but is it free? What matters more?
