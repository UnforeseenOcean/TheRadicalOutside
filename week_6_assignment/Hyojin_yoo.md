Aadhar, one ID to rule them all

Aadhar is India's centralized database collecting more then 1 billions citizen's demographic data - names, addresses, photographs, mobile numbers, iris scans, and all 10 fingerprints. It seems very ambitious project with no back up plan. The article discusses about multiple problems on security and mass surveillance. 
You can't change your fingerprint but also it can wear off. Irony of trying to crack corrupted welfare program but in the end excluding people who needs it because of technology. 

Article about privacy/surveillance not erasing woman's information on ID card was another irony(even though someone pointed out).  

With very disorganized Google drive I have that probably contain's my personal information, I got worried. 

Having similar system in South Korea(bad residue of military dictatorship) I felt complicated and knew it will fail. Since 2014 we(South Korea) had major crisis of private information leakage and there are debates on re-assigning new number or other system.
