# The Radical Outside Library

## A collaborative class effort to build a new library of critical thinking and reading; written and processed by women, LGBT, and POC.

Let's practice 'reflective thinking'; to not find comfort in how - up to this very day - the story of technology is told to us; by which figures and which systems.

### Assignment

**The Selection**
- Assemble 7 to 10 works for the library written and processed by women, LGBT, and POC.
  - The works can be books, articles, or other forms of **written** material.
- Find the pdf's for these works and upload them to your folder within the TheRadicalOutsideLibrary folder.
- If you can only find a URL for a selected work:
  - Save the web page as a PDF using [this guide](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-save-a-webpage-as-a-pdf/). Ask Melanie if you have questions about this.
- Name your files with a number, followed by the last name of the author, followed the title (or a word from the title). Ex: 2-haroway-cyborg.pdf

**The Bibliography**
- Create a bibliography entry for each work included by editing the folder called **bibliography.md**
  - Number your bibliography entries with the corresponding number of that file name. (see the `_example-student/` folder for reference).
  - Use the [Chicago style of bibliography notation](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html).


### Notes
- Use [_example-student/](https://github.com/morehshin/TheRadicalOutside/tree/master/TheRadicalOutsideLibrary/_example-student) as a reference for how your folders should be structured.
- Before the session's end, there should be at least 8 files in your folder.
  - A .pdf file for each work you've included (between 7-10) and one bibliography.md file.
