# The Radical Outside Library

## A collaborative class effort to build a new library of critical thinking and reading; written and processed by women (+LGBT) and POC.

Let's practice 'reflective thinking'; to not find comfort in how - up to this very day - the story of technology is told to us; by which figures and which systems.

### Assignment:
- Assemble 7 to 10 works for the library.
  - The works can be books, articles, or other forms of **written** material.
- Find the pdf's for these works and upload them to your folder within the TheRadicalOutsideLibrary folder.
- If you can only find a URL for a selected work:
  - copy and paste the text and put it in a .md file with the original URL at the top. (see the example-student folder for reference)
- For every work that you include in your library folder, add it to your bibliography in the file called **bibliography.md**.
  - Use the [Chicago style of bibliography notation](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html).


### Notes
- Before the session's end, there should be at least 8 files in your folder.
- A .pdf or .md file for each work you've included (7-10) and 1 bibliography.md file.
