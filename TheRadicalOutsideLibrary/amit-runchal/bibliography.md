It's interesting that Github/Git is basically as exclusionary as English (Github is far more worrying obviously) but the people who use it for works they think are inclusive don't see or talk about that, at least very openly, and they continue to use it. I don't see this as a criticism, but mainly to support my hypothesis that privilege is always invisible to those who wield it and also used to justify their approach to the work, rather than acknowledging that it is impossible to be any sort of human without excluding or exploiting others.

Also Markdown, lol.
