Yo.

It's interesting that Github/Git is basically as exclusionary as English (Github is far more worrying obviously) but the people who use it for works they think are inclusive don't see or talk about that, at least very openly, and they continue to use it. I don't see this as a criticism, but mainly to support my hypothesis that privilege is always invisible to those who wield it and also used to justify their approach to the work, rather than acknowledging that it is impossible to be any sort of human without excluding or exploiting others.

Also Markdown, lol. 

A quick note about this: I don't have a lot of of critical theory stuff to drop in because I have a shitty memory and don't remember what was important to me or informed me in college. A lot of it crit did affect me — but I can't remember it. Also, I'm sure a lot of what I read that was important to me was by straight white dudes so, like, looking forward to reading new shit that will change the way I look at the world. 

Anyway: here's some writing by women/POC/LGTBQ that have been important to me recently and have both been things that have reflected my life as well as how I view the world. Most of them are recent. Almost all of them are books, so I don't have PDFs for those.
