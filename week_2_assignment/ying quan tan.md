It also seems that technology requires amassing resources, which also means amassing people. In this sense, there can be no artifact without politics, but there would be little other human edifices that have no politics as well.  However, Winner’s case is definitely convincing, as he prompts me to think about technologies not so much as salves for our problems, but as tradeoffs we make between different realities.

It begs the question, which of the narratives of our seemingly innocuous technologies have the power to marginalize? Bitcoin, for all it’s promises of decentralization, seems to place the power in a techno-elite that control the source code. The recent fork in Bitcoin source code is proof that there are different versions of the ideal that one can subscribe to. However, I believe that technological innovation has always carried on it’s march, regardless of whether there is politics involved. The best approach we have is to engage early and often, and be voices in shaping the arrangement, to use Winner’s own words, of technologies.
