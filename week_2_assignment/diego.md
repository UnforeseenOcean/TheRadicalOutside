It’s interesting how we can think that everything around us, every tool, every development has been created without a political goal behind. That everything was created by humans for serve in a positive way to other humans. 
It’s almost logical to think that way and it's also naive. When you think it deeply, you realized that almost everything has a political idea/interest. 
It’s scary to think it that way.

Technology has no positive or negative “intentions”, it’s the context, the organizations, the group surrounding the tech that can used it with certain interest. Economics, profit, racial, social.
"What matters is not technology itself, but the social or economic system in which it is embedded."

The example of Robert Moses, building those bridges with a racial interest behind, make me think of a few big examples in chile. 
Like the big educational system in my country was build systematically thinking of social and economic segregation, keeping the rich people with the rich, the poorest with the poorest. That way the breach for people been successful grows bigger and bigger.
This kind of educational development definitely keeps in mind a political interest behind.

It’s technology political? If it’s political, therefore always it’s gonna exist bad and good technologies, positive and negative, evil?
What if our society was different? No capitalist? What kind of social structure would let technology really served on behalf of the humanity?

There is a project by Jacque Fresco, where he rethink the global society from the beginning. Thinking in technology as the main tool for serve the humanity. Erasing capitalism based cities and countries. In fact he doesn’t believe in borders and different governments. I think in this case we can think as technology as truly unpolitical and helpful for the man kind.

The Venus Project proposes an alternative vision of what the future can be if we apply what we already know in order to achieve a sustainable new world civilization. It calls for a straightforward redesign of our culture in which the age-old inadequacies of war, poverty, hunger, debt and unnecessary human suffering are viewed not only as avoidable, but as totally unacceptable. Anything less will result in a continuation of the same catalog of problems inherent in today's world.


Quotes:

What matters is not technology itself, but the social or economic system in which it is embedded.

Two ways in which artifacts can contain political properties. First are instances in which the invention, design, or arrangement of a specific technical device or system becomes a way of settling an issue in a particular community.

By "politics," I mean arrangements of power and authority in human associations as well as the activities that take place within those arrangements.

It turns out, however, that the two hundred or so low-hanging overpasses on Long Island were deliberately designed to achieve a particular social effect.

Robert Moses had these overpasses built to specifications that would discourage the presence of buses on his parkways.

Automobile  owning whites of "upper" and "comfortable middle" classes, as he called them, would be free to use the parkways for recreation and commuting. Poor people and blacks, who normally used public transit, were kept off the roads because the twelve-foot tall buses could not get through the overpasses.

It is obvious that technologies can be used in ways that enhance the power, authority, and privilege of some over others, for example, the use of television to sell a candidate.

By the late 1970s an estimated thirty-two thousand jobs in the tomato industry had been eliminated as a direct consequence of mechanization.


"if you accept nuclear power plants, you also accept a techno-scientific-industrial military elite. without these people in charge, you could not have nuclear power."


Taking the most obvious example, the atom bomb is an inherently political artifact.
he internal social system of the bomb must be authoritarian; there is no other way.

The social consequences of build ing renewable energy systems will surely depend on the specific configurations of both hardware and the social institutions created to bring that energy to us.
