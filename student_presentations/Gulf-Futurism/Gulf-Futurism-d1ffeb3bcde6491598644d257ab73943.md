Middle East and Other Futurisms: Imaginary Temporalities in Contemporary Art and Visual Culture - Jussi Parrikka 

“People were having so many boyfriends on the phone.” These days, anonymous teenage sexting means you’re just as likely to get an ** explicit Bluetooth picture at the mall as a scribbled phone number, which might be why Saudi Arabia banned Bluetooth in malls in 2007.** “ Back (in the 90s) we’d send pre-internet viral videos, these really primal and bizarre moments,” Al-Maria says, remembering her clandestine teenage communications. “ **The Gulf is such an extreme place of disconnection that the only thing to do was send videos of other people or animals doing things that you wish you could.** ”

## Human & Personal Geography

> It's like you're on the surface of another planet . . . the starkness creates this post-apocalyptic feel. Where you're surrounded by sand and the sky, there are no limits to the gargantuanism you can dream of - the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Tower of Babel, these are all Arab ideas! And now it's the space race for skyscrapers - Fatima Al Qadiri

## Dislocations, disaspora and dyschronia

Disaspora - the dispersion of the Jews beyond Israel.

Dyschronia - a lack of comprehension, awareness, and ability to manipulate concepts of time

# **Spatial & Temporal disloaction **

 **Placelessness & Territory **

# Placelessness and territory

"Write future into existence as ways to tell a story where time is now being infrastructured as it was earlier in historiographical sense of Western modernity as a hegemonic project"

> instead of merely accepting the notion of a cancellation of future, the cancellation of future becomes quickly shifted into a tactical multiplication;

> instead of mourning a lost future, the practices turn to looking at conditions of time and temporality as central to function of power, mapping the situations in which futurity is important for current practices of living, and where an analysis of dislocations of identity and time can also turn into more than mere dystopic representations.

# Sinofuturism

Science Fiction embrace and amplify Stereotypes as forms of critique on the present. 

> In Western media and Orientalist perceptions, China is exotic, strange, bizarre, kitsch, tacky, or cheap. In its domestic media, China portrayed as heroic, stable, historic, grand, and unified. Rather than counteract these skewed narratives, Sinofuturism proposes to push them much further. - Lawrence Lek
