I do agree that artifacts have political qualities.
Considering that the purpose of technology is to provide its user with some kind of advantage, I would argue that a new technology always inherits the value system of the context it arises in.
Therefor I do miss that the author is only scarcely mentioning capitalism as the main concept that governs most societies. Since the maxim of capitalism is private ownership and profit maximization, and not solidarity and equal profit distribution.
